**Research Articles**

**Article 1**

Late summer movements by giant Canada geese in relation to a September hunting season 
- Hypothesis: Major movements to new areas by molted Canada geese are related to the start of hunting season in September 
- Control: Geese studied- VHF & satellite transmitters to track adult female geese with broods
- Independent Variables: Time of year, specifically Sept hunting season
- Dependent Variables: post molt Canada goose movements 

_Critique_

I think that this experiment was done pretty well in terms of collecting tangible data from the movements geese made in July through to September. One thing that may decrease external validity is the fact that the experiments took place in locations with heavy hunting patterns, which is not applicable everywhere. A potential confound could be that the geese are just moving north because of the weather. From July until September, 46% of the marked geese made major movements. 43% moved within the first 10 days of hunting season in September. This data makes it hard to distinguish if the geese are making major movements due to hunting season or the migratory patterns typically made by birds when it starts to get cold.

_Our Hypothesis_

Canada geese are prone to making major movements after they molt from established migratory tradition

**Article 2**

Brood Size in Canada Geese: A Manipulation Experiment 
- Hypothesis: the brood size will affect both goslings and adults, the larger the brood the smaller the chance of the young surviving up to a reproductive age
- Control: location
- Independent Variables: brood size
- Dependent Variables: survival abilities of goslings, parental abilities of adults

_Critique_

I believe that the internal validity of this study is fairly sound, as they were able to manipulate the sizes of the geese families. This manipulation showed that the size had little to no affect on the abilities of goslings to survive and the parents abilities to parent the young. This could probably be extended to other real life situations in which geese have relatively large or small broods, giving this study high external validity

_Our Hypothesis_

The goslings are able to survive regardless of the brood size because Canada geese do not rely on their parents to feed them like other species of birds do

**Article 3**

  More-than-human territoriality: the contested spaces and beastly places of Canada geese in Europe’s largest urban wetland
- Hypothesis: This article focuses on Canada geese to examine how species claim territory and assert themselves amidst city renaturing 
- Control: location- Walthamstow Wetlands 
- Independent Variables: interviews
- Dependent Variables: interviewee’s answers 

_Critique_

I think one thing that lacks from this article is direct observation or experimentation with the geese themselves. An interviewer spoke to various participants from field practitioners to local residents and bird enthusiasts. They explain how a lot of the interviewees view the territorial nature of geese, and even points out a specific interview in which a goose started to portray its territoriality. I believe that this study has low internal validity because it includes possible uncontrolled and extraneous variables.

_Our Hypothesis_

Canada geese are prone to territoriality, even in more populated urban areas

**Article 4**

The Vee Formation of Canada Geese  
- Hypothesis: the positions in which Canada geese fly to migrate give the flock an aerodynamic advantage
- Control: camera position & angle
- Independent Variables: each flock of geese
- Dependent Variables: the aerodynamic advantage of each flock’s formation

_Critique_

I think this research article does a good job of explaining what they’re studying and why. Although they end up refuting their hypothesis based on claims from other scientists, the test has a good chance of having external validity. I also believe that their internal validity is sound as their equations and methods for measuring distance between the birds in each flock helped to create data that measured the distances between each bird in each flock.

_Our Hypothesis_

Migratory patterns in Canada geese are seemingly random and used to strengthen coordination and communication among a flock.

**Article 5**

  Dominance Relationships and Agonistic Behavior of Canada Geese in Winter  
- Hypothesis: studying dominance in Canada geese families will contribute to the function and overall understanding of the hierarchies and relationships between geese in these families
- Control: location, Crab Orchard National Wildlife, geese studied- color marked to distinguish 
- Independent Variables: time of year- specifically measured during late September to mid march
- Dependent Variables: patterns and behavior linked to dominance 

_Critique_

I believe that while this study can show the fighting patterns, and reasoning behind them, of the geese, one major potential confound can be the time of year. They studied this over two years, both from late sept to mid march. As far as I can tell, no research was done in the summer months to compare behaviors from then and the winter months. If they were specifically looking for behaviors in the winter, that may lower internal validity. However, if their goal was just to contribute to general knowledge of Canada geese behavior, their studies may have a higher internal and external validity

_Our Hypothesis_

Patterns and behaviors of Canada goose families stay relatively consistent throughout the year, excluding migratory movements

**Research Design**

The hypothesis I choose for the research design is, “Canada geese are prone to making major movements after they molt from established migratory tradition” This hypothesis is taken from our first article, Late Summer Movements by Giant Canada Geese in Relation to a September Hunting Season. This article talks about how there is a relation between when geese migrate and move during or when the September hunting season begins. The research design used on this would be the quasi-experimental design, which includes a cause-and-effect relationship between the two. The cause and effect of each other would be the dependent and independent variables in the research. In this case, the dependent variable is the post-molt movement by the Canadian geese. The independent variable is the time of year the geese migrate, which is late summer into September when the hunters arrive. This research design connects with this article because how it explains the cause and effect between the geese and the hunters. These variables affect both parties because if the hunters show up during the regular hunting season, a substantial number of geese will already have migrated and there will be nothing for the hunters to hunt for. Quasi-experiments such as this one lack randomization and other types of control. With little control over the weather, hunting season, and the geese themselves, the internal validity of this experiment can be quite low, with confounds like different motivations for the migration needing to be considered.

**Research Ethics** 

When thinking about research and the ethics that come along with all it, there can be many ethical issues you can run into before beginning research. A typical evaluation used to conduct a successful ethics check is the risks/benefits ratio. This evaluation is the step in your research to determine if the project is safe to continue or not. To complete the ratio, you must understand the benefits and risks for the people or animals involved in the project, as well as what costs may come after the project is finished. When we conducted our research while taking pictures and videos of the Canadian geese, we determined that this would lead to minimal risk for both the geese and us, the researchers. Because of this, we decided it was okay to proceed with our research and pictures. As for our research design, it seemed to carry a higher risk for both parties involved. To track their migratory patterns, geese were tagged with satellite transmitters. This could lead to potential harm to both the geese and the researcher tagging them. The article explains the methods for capturing and tagging the birds, easing concerns of unethical behavior going on by explaining the process and lab involved in the process. When animals are involved, there are always going to be debated on whether they are considered ethical at all, but assuming the study followed laws and regulations when working with these geese the study can be deemed ethical.
